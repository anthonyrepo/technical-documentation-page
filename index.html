                            <p>
                                A <em>value</em> is one of the basic things a program works with, like a letter or a number. The values we have
                                seen so far are 1, 2, and “Hello, World!”
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                These values belong to different <em>types</em>: 2 is an integer, and “Hello, World!” is a <em>string</em>, so called
                                because it contains a “string” of letters. You (and the interpreter) can identify strings because they are enclosed in quotation marks.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The <code>print</code> statement also works for integers. We use
                                the <code>python</code> command to start the interpreter.
                            </p>
        
                            <!--User Story #6-->
                            <pre><code>python<br>>> print(4)<br>4</code></pre>
                            <p>If you are not sure what type a value has, the interpreter can tell you.</p>
                            <pre><code>>>> type('Hello, World!')<br>&ltclass 'str'><br>>>> type(17)<br>&ltclass 'int'></code></pre>
                            <p>
                                Not surprisingly, strings belong to the type <code>str</code> and integers belong to the type <code>int</code>. Less obviously,
                                numbers with a decimal point belong to a type called <code>float</code>, because these numbers are represented
                                in a format called <em>floating point</em>.
                            </p>
                            <pre><code>>>> type('17')<br>&ltclass 'str'><br>>> type('3.2')<br>&ltclass 'str'></code></pre>
                            <p>They’re strings.</p>
                            <p>
                                When you type a large integer, you might be tempted to use commas between groups of three digits, as in 1,000,000. This is not a legal integer
                                in Python, but it is legal:
                            </p>
                            <pre><code>>>> print(1,000,000)<br>1 0 0</code></pre>
                            <p>Well, that’s not what we expected at all! Python interprets 1,000,000 as a comma-separated sequence of integers, which it prints with spaces between.</p>
                            <p>This is the first example we have seen of a semantic error: the code runs without producing an error message, but it doesn’t do the “right” thing.</p>
        
                            <h2 id="Variables">Variables</h2>
                            <p>One of the most powerful features of a programming language is the ability to manipulate <em>variables</em>. A variable is a name that refers to a value.</p>
                            <p>An <em>assignment</em> statement creates new variables and gives them values:</p>
                            <pre><code>>>> message = 'And now for something completely different'<br>>>> n = 17<br>>>> pi = 3.1415926535897931</code></pre>
                            <p>
                                This example makes three assignments. The first assigns a string to a new variable named <code>message</code>; the second assigns the integer 17 to n; the third assigns
                                the (approximate) value of π to <code>pi</code>.
                            </p>
                            <p>To display the value of a variable, you can use a print statement:</p>
                            <pre><code>>>> print(n)<br>17<br>>>> print(pi)<br>3.141592653589793</code></pre>
                            <p>The type of a variable is the type of the value it refers to.</p>
                            <pre><code>>>> type(message)<br>&ltclass 'str'><br>>>> type(n)<br>&ltclass 'int'><br>>>> type(pi)<br>&ltclass 'float'></code></pre>
        
                            <h2 id="Variable_names_and_keywords">Variable names and keywords</h2>
                            <p>Programmers generally choose names for their variables that are meaningful and document what the variable is used for.</p>
                            <p>
                                Variable names can be arbitrarily long. They can contain both letters and numbers, but they cannot start with a number. It is legal to use uppercase letters, but it is
                                a good idea to begin variable names with a lowercase letter (you’ll see why later).
                            </p>

                                The underscore character ( _ ) can appear in a name. It is often used in names with multiple words, such as <code>my_name</code> or <code>airspeed_of_unladen_swallow</code>. Variable names can
                                start with an underscore character, but we generally avoid doing this unless we are writing library code for others to use.
                            </p>
                            <p>If you give a variable an illegal name, you get a syntax error:</p>
                            <pre><code>>>> 76trombones = 'big parade'<br>SyntaxError: invalid syntax<br>>>> more@ = 1000000<br>SyntaxError: invalid syntax<br>>>> class = 'Advanced Theoretical Zymurgy'<br>SyntaxError: invalid syntax</code></pre>
                            <p><code>76trombones</code> is illegal because it begins with a number. <code>more@</code> is illegal because it contains an illegal character, @. But what’s wrong with <code>class?</code></p>
                            <p>It turns out that <code>class</code> is one of Python’s <em>keywords</em>. The interpreter uses keywords to recognize the structure of the program, and they cannot be used as variable names.</p>
                            <p>Python reserves 35 keywords:</p>
                            <pre><code>and      del     from    None     True<br>as       elif    global  nonlocal try<br>assert   else    if      not      while<br>break    except  import  or       with<br>class    False   in      pass     yield<br>continue finally is      raise    async<br>def      for     lambda  return   await</code></pre>
                            <p>You might want to keep this list handy. If the interpreter complains about one of your variable names and you don’t know why, see if it is on this list.</p>

                            <p>A <em>statement</em> is a unit of code that the Python interpreter can execute. We have seen two kinds of statements: print being an expression statement and assignment.</p>
                            <p>When you type a statement in interactive mode, the interpreter executes it and displays the result, if there is one.</p>
                            <p>A script usually contains a sequence of statements. If there is more than one statement, the results appear one at a time as the statements execute.</p>
                            <p>For example, the script</p>
                            <pre><code>print(1)<br>x = 2<br>print(x)</code></pre>
                            <p>produces the output</p>
                            <pre><code>1<br>2</code></pre>
                            <p>The assignment statement produces no output.</p>
        
                            <h2 id="Operators_and_operands">Operators and operands</h2>
                            <p><em>Operators</em> are special symbols that represent computations like addition and multiplication. The values the operator is applied to are called <em>operands</em>.</p>
                            <p>The operators <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>*</code>, <code>/</code>, and <code>**</code> perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation, as in the following examples:</p>
                            <pre><code>20+32<br>hour-1<br>hour*60+minute<br>minute/60<br>5**2<br>(5+9)*(15-7)</code></pre>
                            <p>There has been a change in the division operator between Python 2.x and Python 3.x. In Python 3.x, the result of this division is a floating point result:</p>
                            <pre><code>>>> minute = 59<br>>>> minute/60<br>0.9833333333333333</code></pre>
                            <p>To obtain the same answer in Python 3.0 use floored ( <code>//</code> integer) division.</p>
                            <pre><code>>>> minute = 59<br>>> minute//60<br>0</code></pre>
                            <p>In Python 3.0 integer division functions much more as you would expect if you entered the expression on a calculator.</p>
                            
                            <h2 id="Expressions">Expressions</h2>
                            <p>
                                An <em>expression</em> is a combination of values, variables, and operators. A value all by itself is considered an expression, and so is a variable, so the following are all legal expressions (assuming that the
                                variable <code>x</code> has been assigned a value):
                            </p>
                            <pre><code>17<br>x<br>x + 17</code></pre>
                            <p>If you type an expression in interactive mode, the interpreter <em>evaluates</em> it and displays the result:</p>
                            <pre><code>>>> 1 + 1<br>2</code></pre>
                            <p>But in a script, an expression all by itself doesn’t do anything! This is a common source of confusion for beginners.</p>
                            <p><strong>Exercise 1: Type the following statements in the Python interpreter to see what they do:</strong></p>
                            <pre><code>5<br>x = 5<br>x + 1</code></pre>
        
                            <h2 id="Order_of_operations">Order of operations</h2>
                            <p>
                                When more than one operator appears in an expression, the order of evaluation depends on the <em>rules of precedence</em>. For mathematical operators, Python follows mathematical convention. The acronym <em>PEMDAS</em> is a
                                useful way to remember the rules:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <p>
                                        Parentheses have the highest precedence and can be used to force an expression to evaluate in the order you want. Since expressions in parentheses are evaluated first, <code>2 * (3-1)</code> is 4, and <code>(1+1)**(5-2)</code> is 8.
                                        You can also use parentheses to make an expression easier to read, as in <code>(minute * 100) / 60</code>, even if it doesn’t change the result.
                                    </p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>
                                        <em>Exponentiation</em> has the next highest precedence, so <code>2**1+1</code> is 3, not 4, and <code>3*1**3</code> is 3, not 27.
                                    </p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>
                                        <em>Multiplication</em> and <em>Division</em> have the same precedence, which is higher than <em>Addition</em> and <em>Subtraction</em>, which also have the same precedence. So <code>2*3-1</code> is 5, not 4, and <code>6+4/2</code> is 8, not 5.
                                    </p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>
                                        Operators with the same precedence are evaluated from left to right. So the expression <code>5-3-1</code> is 1, not 3, because the <code>5-3</code> happens first and then <code>1</code> is subtracted from 2.
                                    </p>
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>When in doubt, always put parentheses in your expressions to make sure the computations are performed in the order you intend.</p>
        
                            <h2 id="Modulus_operator">Modulus operator</h2>
                            <p>
                                The <em>modulus operator</em> works on integers and yields the remainder when the first operand is divided by the second. In Python, the modulus operator is a percent sign (<code>%</code>). The syntax is the same as for other operators:
                            </p>
                            <pre><code>>>> quotient = 7 // 3<br>>>> print(quotient)<br>2<br>>>> remainder = 7 % 3<br>>>> print(remainder)<br>1</code></pre>
                            <p>So 7 divided by 3 is 2 with 1 left over.</p>
                            <p>The modulus operator turns out to be surprisingly useful. For example, you can check whether one number is divisible by another: if <code>x % y</code> is zero, then <code>x</code> is divisible by <code>y</code>.</p>
                            <p>You can also extract the right-most digit or digits from a number. For example, <code>x % 10</code> yields the right-most digit of <code>x</code> (in base 10). Similarly, <code>x % 100</code> yields the last two digits.</p>
        
                            <h2 id="String_operations">String operations</h2>
                            <p>The <code>+</code> operator works with strings, but it is not addition in the mathematical sense. Instead it performs <em>concatenation</em>, which means joining the strings by linking them end to end. For example:</p>
                            <pre><code>>>> first = 10<br>>>> second = 15<br>>>> print(first+second)<br>25<br>>>> first = '100'<br>>>> second = '150'<br>>>> print(first + second)<br>100150</code></pre>
                            <p>The <code>*</code> operator also works with strings by multiplying the content of a string by an integer. For example:</p>
                            <pre><code>>>> first = 'Test '<br>>>> second = 3<br>>>> print(first * second)<br>Test Test Test</code></pre>
        
                            <h2 id="Asking_the_user_for_input">Asking the user for input</h2>
                            <p>
                                Sometimes we would like to take the value for a variable from the user via their keyboard. Python provides a built-in function called <code>input</code> that gets input from the keyboard<sup><a href="#annotation1">1</a></sup>.
                                When this function is called, the program stops and waits for the user to type something. When the user presses <code>Return</code> or <code>Enter</code>, the program resumes and <code>input</code> returns what the user typed as a string.
                            </p>
                            <pre><code>>>> inp = input()<br>Some silly stuff<br>>>> print(inp)<br>Some silly stuff</code></pre>
                            <p>Before getting input from the user, it is a good idea to print a prompt telling the user what to input. You can pass a string to <code>input</code> to be displayed to the user before pausing for input:</p>
                            <pre><code>>>> name = input('What is your name?\n')<br>What is your name?<br>Chuck<br>>>> print(name)<br>Chuck</code></pre>
                            The sequence <code>\n</code> at the end of the prompt represents a <em>newline</em>, which is a special character that causes a line break. That’s why the user’s input appears below the prompt.
                            <p>If you expect the user to type an integer, you can try to convert the return value to <code>int</code> using the <code>int()</code> function:</p>
                            <pre><code>>>> prompt = 'What...is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?\n'<br>>>> speed = input(prompt)<br>What...is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?<br>17<br>>>> int(speed)<br>17<br>>>> int(speed) + 5<br>22</code></pre>
                            <p>But if the user types something other than a string of digits, you get an error:</p>
                            <pre><code>>>> speed = input(prompt)<br>What...is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?<br>What do you mean, an African or a European swallow?<br>>>> int(speed)<br>ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10:</code></pre>
                            <p>We will see how to handle this kind of error later.</p>
        
                            <h2 id="Comments">Comments</h2>
                            <p>As programs get bigger and more complicated, they get more difficult to read. Formal languages are dense, and it is often difficult to look at a piece of code and figure out what it is doing, or why.</p>
                            <p>For this reason, it is a good idea to add notes to your programs to explain in natural language what the program is doing. These notes are called <em>comments</em>, and in Python they start with the <code>#</code> symbol:</p>
                            <pre><code># compute the percentage of the hour that has elapsed<br>percentage = (minute * 100) / 60</code></pre>
                            <p>In this case, the comment appears on a line by itself. You can also put comments at the end of a line:</p>
                            <pre><code>percentage = (minute * 100) / 60     # percentage of an hour</code></pre>
                            <p>Everything from the <code>#</code> to the end of the line is ignored; it has no effect on the program.</p>
                            <p>Comments are most useful when they document non-obvious features of the code. It is reasonable to assume that the reader can figure out <em>what</em> the code does; it is much more useful to explain <em>why</em>.</p>
                            <p>This comment is redundant with the code and useless:</p>
                            <pre><code>v = 5     # assign 5 to v</code></pre>
                            <p>This comment contains useful information that is not in the code:</p>
                            <pre><code>v = 5     # velocity in meters/second.</code></pre>
                            <p>Good variable names can reduce the need for comments, but long names can make complex expressions hard to read, so there is a trade-off.</p>
        
                            <h2 id="Choosing_mnemonic_variable_names">Choosing mnemonic variable names</h2>
                            <p>
                                As long as you follow the simple rules of variable naming, and avoid reserved words, you have a lot of choice when you name your variables. In the beginning, this choice can be confusing both when you read a program
                                and when you write your own programs. For example, the following three programs are identical in terms of what they accomplish, but very different when you read them and try to understand them.
                            </p>
                            <pre><code>a = 35.0<br>b = 12.50<br>c = a * b<br>print(c)</code></pre>
                            <pre><code>hours = 35.0<br>rate = 12.50<br>pay = hours * rate<br>print(pay)</code></pre>
                            <pre><code>x1q3z9ahd = 35.0<br>x1q3z9afd = 12.50<br>x1q3p9afd = x1q3z9ahd * x1q3z9afd<br>print(x1q3p9afd)</code></pre>
                            <p>
                                The Python interpreter sees all three of these programs as <em>exactly the same</em> but humans see and understand these programs quite differently. Humans will most quickly understand the <em>intent</em> of the
                                second program because the programmer has chosen variable names that reflect their intent regarding what data will be stored in each variable.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We call these wisely chosen variable names “mnemonic variable names”. The word mnemonic2 means “memory aid”. We choose <em>mnemonic<sup><a href="#annotation2">2</a></sup></em> variable names to help us
                                remember why we created the variable in the first place.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                While this all sounds great, and it is a very good idea to use mnemonic variable names, mnemonic variable names can get in the way of a beginning programmer’s ability to parse and understand code. This is because
                                beginning programmers have not yet memorized the reserved words (there are only 33 of them) and sometimes variables with names that are too descriptive start to look like part of the language and not just well-chosen variable names.
                            </p>
                            <p>Take a quick look at the following Python sample code which loops through some data. We will cover loops soon, but for now try to just puzzle through what this means:</p>
                            <pre><code>for word in words:<br>    print(word)</code></pre>
                            <p>
                                What is happening here? Which of the tokens (for, word, in, etc.) are reserved words and which are just variable names? Does Python understand at a fundamental level the notion of words? Beginning programmers have trouble
                                separating what parts of the code <em>must</em> be the same as this example and what parts of the code are simply choices made by the programmer.
                            </p>
                            <p>The following code is equivalent to the above code:</p>
                            <pre><code>for slice in pizza:<br>    print(slice)</code></pre>
                            <p>
                                It is easier for the beginning programmer to look at this code and know which parts are reserved words defined by Python and which parts are simply variable names chosen by the programmer. It is pretty clear that Python has no
                                fundamental understanding of pizza and slices and the fact that a pizza consists of a set of one or more slices.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But if our program is truly about reading data and looking for words in the data, <code>pizza</code> and <code>slice</code> are very un-mnemonic variable names. Choosing them as variable names distracts from the meaning of the program.
                            </p>
                            <p>After a pretty short period of time, you will know the most common reserved words and you will start to see the reserved words jumping out at you:</p>
                            <pre><code>for word in words:<br>    print(word)</code></pre>
                            <p>
                                The parts of the code that are defined by Python (<code>for</code>, <code>in</code>, <code>print</code>, and <code>:</code>) are in bold and the programmer-chosen variables (<code>word</code> and <code>words</code>) are not in bold. Many text editors are aware of Python syntax and will color
                                reserved words differently to give you clues to keep your variables and reserved words separate. After a while you will begin to read Python and quickly determine what is a variable and what is a reserved word.
                            </p>

                            <p>At this point, the syntax error you are most likely to make is an illegal variable name, like <code>class</code> and <code>yield</code>, which are keywords, or <code>odd~job</code> and US$, which contain illegal characters.</p>
                            <p>If you put a space in a variable name, Python thinks it is two operands without an operator:</p>
                            <pre><code>>>> bad name = 5<br>SyntaxError: invalid syntax</code></pre>
                            <pre><code>>>> month = 09<br>    File "<stdin>", line 1<br>      month = 09<br>               ^<br>  SyntaxError: invalid token</code></pre>
                            <p>For syntax errors, the error messages don’t help much. The most common messages are <code>SyntaxError: invalid syntax</code> and <code>SyntaxError: invalid token</code>, neither of which is very informative.</p>
                            <p>The runtime error you are most likely to make is a “use before def;” that is, trying to use a variable before you have assigned a value. This can happen if you spell a variable name wrong:</p>
                            <pre><code>>>> principal = 327.68<br>>>> interest = principle * rate<br>NameError: name 'principle' is not defined</code></pre>
                            <p>Variables names are case sensitive, so <code>LaTeX</code> is not the same as <code>latex</code>.</p>
                            <p>At this point, the most likely cause of a semantic error is the order of operations. For example, to evaluate 1/2π, you might be tempted to write</p>
                            <pre><code>>>> 1.0 / 2.0 * pi</code></pre>
                            <p>But the division happens first, so you would get π/2, which is not the same thing! There is no way for Python to know what you meant to write, so in this case you don’t get an error message; you just get the wrong answer.</p>

                            <p>Hello and welcome to Chapter 2.</p>
                            <p>Now we're gonna just continue to talk about the building blocks of Python, variables, constants, statements, expressions, et cetera.</p>
                            <p>
                                The first thing we have to talk about is constants. These are just things we call 'em constants 'cause they don't change. There are numbers, strings, et cetera, and we use them to sorta start calculations or, you know, if something is
                                greater than 40 hours we're gonna do something, so 40 is the constant in that situation.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So, we have 123, we have 98.6, we have 'Hello World', which is a string by enclosing it in quotes, we pass each of these things to the print function, and a side effect of the print function is that we see the output. So print(123),
                                prints out 123, print(98.6), prints it out.
                            </p>
                            <p>So these are just really the syntax of constants and without constants we can't write really much of anything.</p>
                            <p>
                                The other sort of foundational notion of any programming language are the reserved word, and like I said before, reserved words are these special words where Python is listening for them and there is very special meanings, so when
                                Python sees if, it's not just any other word, it means how Python implements conditional execution.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Variables are the third building block, and that is a way that you can ask Python to allocate a piece of memory and then give it a name, and you can put stuff in that. Sometimes you just put one value. Later we'll see, we do
                                collections in chapters eight and nine. We will see that more than one value can be put into a variable. And the variable, how we control the variable, is through the assignment statement, and as I said before, it's important to
                                think of the assignment statement as having an arrow to it.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So this is not saying x for all time is the same as 12.2, what it's saying is take 12.2, find a place, find some memory in your computer there Mr. Python, give it a label x, we get to choose the x, that's the variable part, we chose
                                it, right, and then stick 12 in it, and then the same is true for 14, go find another spot, name it y, and then put a 14 in there. So, think of this as an arrow every time you see that equality, the assignment, in an assignment statement.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Now, these variables hold one value. So now if we have these three statements, these two, and then the third one executes, it says put 100 into x, but that wipes out the old value of 12.2 and it rewrites it with 100, and so we can
                                change the variables; that's another reason that we call them a variable.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                There are some names, now insert some rules for making variable names. You can start with a letter or an underscore. We tend not to as normal programmers use underscore, we tend to reserve those for variables that we use to
                                communicate with Python itself, so when we're making up a variable, we tend not to use underscores as a first character. You can have letters and numbers and underscores after the first character and they're case sensitive but it's
                                really a bad idea to use case as the only differentiator.
                            </p>
                            <p>So, in this case, spam, eggs, spam23, and _speed, are all totally legit. We would probably not use this one unless we were actually doing it because Python told us to use that variable.</p>
                            <p>
                                23spam starts with a number, #sign is starts and dot is not a legitimate variable character. And spam, Spam, and SPAM are different, but this is not something that you want to sort of depend on too much, so that's just the rule names.
                                We tend to start them with a letter and then use letters, numbers, and underscores. Underscores other than the first character are generally pretty common and you'll see those used a lot.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Now, when we're choosing variable names, one of things about variables, is we get to choose the name; we get to choose the name x, choose the name y, And so sometimes we like 'em short but sometimes we want them descriptive, and the
                                notion that of making variables descriptive is often confusing to beginning students. Sometimes it's really helpful to, if you're gonna have a line of text and you name the variable line, that's great, because the next person reading
                                your program says, oh that must be the line of text. Whereas, it also can become misleading, that line, the name of a variable, somehow has meaning.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So sometimes we'll have even singular variables and plural variables, like friend and friends, you know like is plural? Does Python know about singular and plural? And the answer is no. So sometimes we pick variables that make no
                                sense, sometimes we pick variables that make a lot of sense. This is just something that you as a beginning programmer are going to have to understand that we can pick anything we want. And so, you'll see I'll try to call attention
                                to this in the first few lectures as we go through.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So here's a bit a code with an assignment statement, two assignment statements, a multiplication, and a print statement, and you can say what is this doing? Now, Python is perfectly happy with this code 'cause it assigns it in
                                there, you have said please go give me this as a label, and then we assign two variables and then we're carefully pulling these two variables back out, multiplying them together, and sticking them into yet another variable
                                and then printing that variable out. That seems like, you know, how we can figure out what it is, you just have to look really careful, and a single character mistake, and Python is gonna be, you know, pretty unhappy, okay? So
                                that's one way to write this program. It's hard though, because any of those characters are long variable and they're random stuff, it's not very friendly to anyone who might read your program.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Now this looks a little friendlier. It's the same program, because Python just wants a correspondence. You pick a, you pick b, and you pick c, and it's really much easier for us to see what's going on, and so this is, in a way
                                going from here to here, is much friendlier, but, we can being even friendlier if we pick mnemonic variable names.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So this is, this is not mnemonic, this is short and convenient, this is long and inconvenient. Python is happy with any of these. Here on the other hand, is another version of the exact same program, and now you think to
                                yourself, oh yeah, now I get it. 35 is the number of hours, 12.50 is the rate, and then we're gonna multiply the hours and the rate and come up with the pay, and we're printing out the pay. Now whoever wrote this program
                                is helping us greatly understand what's going on, and that's good. Choosing variable names, Python again, all three of these are the same to Python. Choosing variable names in a way that help your reader understand what's
                                going on, is a great thing.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The problem is, the danger is, if you read this and you think that somehow Python understands payroll; that if you name a variable hours that Python knows what hours means. The answer is, Python, really doesn't care what
                                you name the variable, as long as what you name it you use it, right, and so you gotta be careful. And so you'll see, when I write my code in these first few weeks, first few lectures, I will sometimes write it with
                                gibberish, I'll sometimes write it with extremely short but meaningless variable names and sometimes I'll use meaningful variable names and I'll call your attention to it and it will get you. You'll start, when you look
                                at this third kind it has meaningful variables or mnemonic variable names, you'll just instinctively want to give Python more intelligence than it sort of deserves. I guess that's probably the best way to say that.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So, we've talked about constants, we've talked about reserved words, we talked about variables. And so, here we have a sentence, like we've already done some of these things, where we said x = 2, we retrieve the old value
                                of x and add 2 to it, so that becomes 4, and then we print 4 out. Print is a function that's built-in and we pass in whatever we want to print out, so this parenthesis is part of a function call.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Okay, so an assignment statement, you have to really get your head around the notion that it has this arrow nature, and that it valuates this entire right-hand side before we change the left-hand side, and so you can
                                think of this sort of as at time step 1 it does this and then at time step 2 it does the copy, and that's how you can have something like x on both sides of an assignment statement.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                And so, if for example we have x, and x has 0.6 in it, x has 0.6 in it, what happens is, is that, it first it sort of ignores this part right here and evaluates the expression. So it pulls the 0.6, everywhere x appears,
                                it pulls 0.6 out, then it starts running these calculations, and then it has the new value. After all the calculations are done, then and only then is it going to put that back into x. And so it sort of takes that and
                                puts it back into x, and then wipes out the old value. At this point, this has all been taken care and it's been reduced down to this 0.93, and so that is what's put in as the new value.
                            </p>
                            <p>So, up next, we'll talk a little bit more about making more complex expressions.</p>

                            <h3>Transcript</h3>
                            <p>So welcome back, we're now going to talk about expressions. Expressions are a little more complex calculations that we can sorta do on the right hand side of an assignment statement.</p>
                            <p>
                                So one of the things about expressions is operators, and then operators in computer programming are often very much the same as the mathematical operators. But we don't have all the fancy characters that we have in
                                mathematics, and so we have to choose what's on the keyboard. And then we really go back to the 1960s and 1970s and then we use what was on the keyboard in the 1960s and the 1970s to make these operators. So plus
                                is addition, minus is subtraction, we don't have a times sign or a dot in the middle, so we use the asterisk as multiplication, division, we can't put two things over the top of each other so we use slash for
                                division, raising to the power, because they didn't have little characters back then is star star, which is raising to the power, and then remainder, remainder is the, when you do integer division, it's also
                                called the modulo operator, it's the remainder, not the quotient and I've got a picture of that coming up.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So here's a whole series of little examples of this, right, so we've already seen, you know, the plus, x equals x plus 1, keep remembering that these assignments are arrows, basically, arrow, arrow the other
                                direction. Multiplication, 440 times 12. Dividing this by that's division, over 1000, 5.28. Here we're gonna put 23 into jj and then we'll do modulo. So that says take 23 divided by five and give me back the
                                remainder and put it in kk. So this is the expression that evaluates like this. Take 23 divide five into 23, four remainder three. The three is what comes back up here, okay? And so that is the remainder, it's
                                also called the modulo operator.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It turns out for things like, picking a random number and then taking the modulo of 52, is a way to pick a card randomly. So this modulo operator is actually a specialty in games and other things, super useful.
                                So that's the various operators.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It's important to know which of these operators goes first. It's called operator precedence. Now normally we put parentheses in. Like you know, so if I put the parentheses in here, I'd say this goes first
                                parentheses, then this goes first, actually not that one. Whoops, got that one wrong. This happens first, this happens, then this happens. Okay? But it's important for us to be able to know if there were not
                                parentheses the order in which these things will happen. So the way things work, in terms of operator precedence, is parentheses are the most important thing, followed by raising to the power, all those being
                                equal, multiplication and division, are both equal, and then addition, and then within it's adding left to right.
                            </p>
                            <p>So let's see an example of how this works. And so if we take one plus two, raised to the three power, divided by four, times five. And we print out what comes out of this.</p>
                            <p>
                                So, the way I did this when I was taking exams back many, many years ago when I was first in computer science, is I'd write it all down and I'd look for the highest precedence thing. Now parentheses would make
                                this easy. But exponentiation is the first one, so that means we're gonna take this, and that's gonna be eight. Two to the third power, two times two times two. Two cubed is eight. Then what I would do is, I
                                would rewrite the whole thing with the eight there, and I'd look across, and I'm looking for multiplications. Because the powers been done, the multiplication's what I'm looking for next. And then there is
                                both multiplication and division. They are equal, they're at the same level. And so what happens is, they're done left to right. Eight divided by four happens before four times five. And so the fact that it's
                                not four times five, but instead eight times four, is because of the left to right rule. So then this gets rewritten to be two. One plus two times five. And this one, multiplication is the top one, so that does
                                this next. Two times five becomes ten. I rewrite it again. And then one plus 10, addition is the lowest thing. And that's how we end up with 11. And so that's how I would do these problems if I ever saw the
                                problem on an exam. And it's a fun problem to put on exams because there is one and only one answer, and every programming class has usually at least one slide about this stuff. So like I said, the rules go
                                top to bottom, parentheses, power, multiplication, addition, and then left to right within it.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So, we talked about variables and computing values to put inside variables, but the one thing you kind of also, maybe you noticed today as we go by, is we have different kinds of data. We call it type. Is this
                                of type integer? Is this of type floating point number? Is it of type string? What is going on here? And Python is pretty smart about various kinds of types of data. And so, you know, we're adding one plus four
                                here, and Python knows as it looks at this that that's an integer and that's an integer. And will add it together and make it an integer. So that thing is an integer. We can also use this plus to get get need
                                to strings. This is hello blank plus there. And plus looks here and says, oh that's a string and that's a string, so I know what to do with strings. I will concatenate those two things together so it become
                                another string that gets assigned into eee and it's hello space there. The plus doesn't add the space, I added the space by putting it right there. And so these operators are kind of smart, in that they kind of
                                know what they're dealing with and sometimes they will do one thing or another, depending on the kinds of values, variables, or constants that they're working with.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                And so, sometimes type can get us in trouble. So here we have eee, which is hello there, because we concatenated these two strings together, and now we're adding one. And the problem now, is that it looks on one
                                side and says, that's a string and that's a number and says, I don't know how to do that. This is another one of those annoying errors that you think that somehow Python doesn't like you, but it just is confused.
                                If you look at these things, trace back, trace back always means I quit. Means I stopped, I ran, I'm quitting now because I don't want to go any farther because I've become confused. So your program stops running
                                and you say, here's where I stopped running. Because we're typing interactively, it's always line one here. Type it, but you read carefully and you don't get too stuck on too much stuff, line one that tells us
                                something. In module>TypeError: Can't covert 'int' object to str implicitly. So that's an integer right there, and that's a string, and that's what it's complaining about. That little bit right there.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If Python is so grumpy about types, then we should be able to ask it about a type. So there turns out that there is, inside Python, a built in function called type, t y p e. So we can pass into type. So this syntax
                                is calling a built in function name type, parentheses is the parameter that we're passing to it. We're saying, hey, hello, tell me something about the type of the variable eee. And so this is a function, the
                                parentheses are part of the function call. And it says, oh that would be of class string. And then we can pass in a constant that says, hey what about hello? The string hello. It's like, oh that's a string too.
                                What about a one? Well that's an integer. And so we're asking Python through the type function, what the type of either a variable or a constant is.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                And there are even several types of numbers and we'll even see Booleans and others later. Like one with no decimal, that's an integer number. 98.6 with a decimal, that's a floating point number. And so, you know,
                                constants and, constants can be both integer and floating point. And I'm just asking over and over and over again, what is the type of, what's in xxx, what's the type of what's in temp, and what's the type of the
                                constant one? And what's the type of 1.0?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                You can also use a set of built in functions like float and int to convert from one to another. And so this basically says, I wanna convert, oops, let's go back. I wanna convert 99 to a floating point number. So
                                this is a function and it's participating in this plus, but before it can finish the plus, it turns this into a 99.0. The difference between 99 as an integer and 99.0 is that it's a floating point number. And that
                                actually turns this computation, as it looks to the left and looks to the right. It says, oh I've got a floating point number on one side, and an integer on the other side. And so I'm gonna make my calculation
                                overall be a floating point calculation. I can also pass into the float function. I can say take this variable i, which has a 42, also an integer, and then give me back a floating point. So that'll be 42.0 pass
                                that into f, we print it out and it is indeed 42.0, and it's a float. And so it knows the type and value in any variable. This is an integer, a value 42. This is a float, a value 42.0.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Integer division in Python 2 was kind of weird. And it was actually one of the big things they changed between Python 2 and Python 3. This is a Python 3 course, so we're not worried about that too much. What's
                                nice about integer division in Python 3 is it always produces a floating point result. And that means that Python 3's division is more predictable and it works more like a calculator. So in this case, I mean
                                you can go back and look at my Python 2 lectures and see how crazy it was in Python 2. 10 divided by two is 5.0, and the weird thing here is these are both integers, but the division forces the result of a
                                calculation to be a floating point number. And this, you know, ten over 2 could be five, but nine over two is 4.5. And so that is accurate. In old Python 2, it would give us back four,which is completely
                                unpredictable and weird. The same with 99 over 100, as you would expect, if this were a calculator you'd get 0.99. Actually what you get in Python 2 is 0. Because it would round it down, it doesn't round at it
                                all truncates it. So 99 over 100 is 0.99 and then it truncates it to zero. That's Python 2, we're not talking about Python 2. There's a good reason we're not talking about Python 2. Welcome to Python 3. Of course
                                if there are a floating point on either side, the result is still a floating point, floating point, and the result is still a floating point. So, integer division produces a floating result in Python 3.0. Not
                                in Python 2.0. That is an improvement in Python 3.0. And that's why we're recording these lectures. I have a whole great set of lectures about Python 2, and now I'm gonna have a great set of lectures about
                                Python 3. Welcome to Python 3.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Okay, so we've been talking about converting from integer to floating point, but you can also convert from sting to integer or string to floating point. And so here we start out with a little string value, now
                                it only works for strings that are made of digits. So "123" is not an integer, it is a three character string that has one, two, three as the characters in that string. Which is very different than 123. We say
                                what is the type of this? It's a string. We say let's add one to it. And it says can't convert "int" to string. So that blows up, right? Cause this is a string. It looks to both sides, string plus an integer, not
                                good, okay?But, we can convert this. We can call the int function, which is like the float function, and pass a string in. So it says, hey, take this and turn it into an integer.So take the input of s val, which
                                is the string "123"and give me back an integer representation of that. Which is going to be 123.So we say what kind of thing did we get back?Well we got back an integer,we can now add one to it and get 124. And
                                so, you have to manage the type of things. And you can convert from one type to another. Now, it is not magic. If you send something into it, a string that doesn't consist of digits, then you're gonna end up
                                with another error. Invalid literal for for integer with base 10, blah blah blah blah blah. So it's really complaining. It says, I want these to be number here, and you just gave me letters. So that's going to
                                cause this to fail.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Another thing that we're going to do with variables is, just like the print function takes something, a list of things, in this case a string comma a variable, and then prints some output in the program, the
                                opposite of that is input. Actually input generally happens before output. Input is a built in function. And we pass to it a prompt. A string of text that's going to be printed out for the user and then it stops
                                and waits. So it says, who are you? And then right here it just sits. Waiting for us to type something. So we type, blah blah blah blah, and then hit the enter key. Right, we hit the enter key, and then this text
                                ends up in this variable. So this is an assignment statement that Chuck is the result of the input call, gets copied into the nam variable.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So let's do that again. It's evaluating an assignment statement. Remember it's kind of this way, or you can think of it as do this right side first. It writes this out. Writes that out. Then it waits. Wait, wait,
                                wait, wait, wait. Until we hit the enter. And takes this Chuck, and that becomes the result of this input. Which is then assigned into nam. Now then we go sequentially to the next line, it prints out Welcome, and
                                any contents of the variable nam. Now this one, this comma here actually does put the space in here automatically. So it says Welcome space Chuck. So there's no space in Chuck, just c h u c k, and so print can
                                take more than one thing, separated by commas.As a matter of fact print can have a whole bunch of. Oops come back come back. Print can have comma, comma, comma parentheses, as many as you like. Everything you've
                                seen up to now is kind of one thing in the print, but that doesn't mean that print only can do one thing.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So I've talked about variables, we've talked about constants, we've talked about input, we've talked about output, and now it is time to write our first meaningful program. And so this program has to do with those
                                of you who have traveled internationally. If you've traveled to the United States and you've traveled outside the United States, you notice that there is an elevator convention that is different inside the United
                                States. The United States, the walk in the ground floor and the elevator that's one. If you want in a ground floor in Europe, or many other places in the world, and the elevator is zero. So we have written a small
                                app, that we're gonna put on the app store and get wealthy with, called Elevator Floor Conversion App. And it's gonna ask us, we're in Europe and we're lost, and you say, well what floor would this be if I was in
                                the United States of America? And so here's we have to read the floor that we are at in Europe, and then we're going to convert it to a U.S. floor, and then we're gonna print it out. This is very silly, but it is
                                a pure essential program that has input, does some kind of task on that input, and the produces some output. Which is useful, for some value of useful, okay?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So let's take a look at how we combine everything that we've learned in this lecture input, processing, and output. It's a three line program, but it's sort of the beginning of something that programs do. Okay,
                                you're gonna do lots of programs that do this.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So, here we go. Program starts. We do the input side effect, it prints out this and then waits. We type in zero. That comes back here. And the zero, which is a string. Input gives you back a string, it doesn't give
                                you back a number. It's a little different in Python 2, but in Python 3 input gives you a string. So "0" which is what we typed here. We didn't type the quotes, it's a string. Gets stored in the inp variable. Then
                                we move to the next statement. And on this right hand side we convert that string variable to an integer. So that become the integer zero. We add one to it and then that becomes one. And then we assign that into usf.
                                I've named this variable United States Floor. Right? So inp is the input and usf. That's mnemonic, it doesn't know anything about elevators. It's just I picked a variable that was quite friendly. And so at this point,
                                usf has the United States floor that's equivalent the the European floor and then I just fall down and I do a print statement. Print out US floor, US floor comma, that's this space right here, and then whatever the
                                contents of the US floor variable is. And you could see that I could write this on four, and it would say three. I could write this in say seven, and it would say six. This is an amazing program. It converts floors in
                                a European numbering scheme. Wait, actually no, I got that wrong. Hang on, let me clear this. I wasn't thinking clearly. I could type in four and it would give me back five. I could type in six and it would give me
                                back seven. See I'm confused. Haven't been in Europe in a couple of months and so I forgot all about the floors. But that's the idea.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Now, this is a super, super, super simple program. Not super useful, but you get the idea that we're gonna pull some data in, we're gonna do some intelligent thing. Soon this will be hundreds of lines of code instead
                                of one line of code. And then we go ahead and present the results to our user.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Now, another element of most any programing language is what's called a comment. Comment is a way for you to put in a program file some text that's to be ignored by Python or SEER, what ever language we happen to be
                                using. In Python comments start with a pound sign. So what you could do is put a pound sign anywhere in a line, and then after the pound sign Python ignores everything after that pound sign. It can be the first character.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So here's our recurring concept that we talk a lot about. We're not gonna cover this. Remember what this does. This is counting how many letters. There's 16 thes. And in that file there were six tos, or whatever it was.
                                This is that code. We'll get back to this code. But what we've done here, is I've added some comments that are really for human consumption.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So this first paragraph is get the name of the file and open it. The second paragraph is count the word frequency. You know maybe I should have said histogram here. Count the word frequency and assemble a histogram. And
                                then here I'm putting this pound sign in, find the most common word. And when I'm all done I print this stuff out. All right? And so all I'm saying is comments are for people to read, your next programmer, or the person
                                who's gonna change your program after you're done with it. And they're nice. And you don't have to use any particularly weird syntax or variable name conventions. You put a pound sign in and you can write anything you
                                want from that point forward.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Okay, so we've talked a little bit about variables, and types, and mnemonics, and how we would choose variable names, and how expressions work, and the various operators, converting between different byte types, printing,
                                input, output, and comments. So that just kind of gets us sentences. Coming up next we'll talk about conditional execution. Where we're really starting to move up to paragraphs. So see ya in a bit.
                            </p>

                            <h3>Transcript</h3>
                            <p>So hello! Welcome to Python for Everybody, I'm Charles Severance, your instructor.</p>
                            <p>In this assignment, I mean in this video, I want to work through exercise 2.2. And it's just a basic hello kind of hello world. So I'm going to show you how I want to do these things.</p>
                            <p>And I've got this folder called Python for Everybody, and I'm gonna use the Adam text editor. So the whole thing is it's supposed to say hello, enter your name. There's the last one we did.</p>
                            <p>
                                Okay, so I'm gonna make in Python for Everybody I'm gonna make a new folder. New folder, and I'm gonna say e x zero two, zero two. Make myself an exercise, and I'm going to create a new file.
                                And I wanna say print hello. And I'm gonna save file, save as, and it's important to get these in the right folder. And so I'm gonna call this e x zero two dot py. Always end these in Python
                                because then you get the syntax highlighting.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Okay, so now... (sighs) Again you're not gonna like this but I want you to learn to execute these things using the tool, the real tools that we're gonna really use because when you're applying
                                this, I want you to know how to actually do real work. So I need to get to the point where this Terminal program, and I can say start run Terminal. That's another way to get the Terminal
                                program started, but I've got it down here in my dock, so that saves me some time. And of course if you're on Windows, this is the command prompt. And so in Windows you'd type cd, but in Mac
                                I type pwd and that shows where I am at in the directory structure. And I can go into my desktop. This would work the same. And I can do an ls. In Windows I would say der, and I see this desktop
                                folder. And I'm gonna go into py4e and if I keep doing pwd, you see I'm navigating deeper and deeper into this directory structure. And then I do an ls here, and I'm gonna cd one more time and
                                if to a folder. Oh, I did that really quick and didn't tell you what I was doing. Cd ex tab, so that's because if the name of the file or folder is unique, you can hit the tab in the command
                                line. And away we go, so now we're in this folder. In the user's folder py4e desktop, py4e ex zero two zero two. And then if I say ls... And that's where you wanna get to. You wanna get to where
                                you know where you're at in the folder structure and you know the file that you're going to run. And I've saved, and so if I save python three ex zero two dot py, it runs. And now I know that
                                what I'm doing in this screen can be run in this screen. And oh, I did that again. I hit the up arrow and I can run it again. So you'll find that the way you write these programs is you write
                                them here, and then write them here and run them here. And again there are shortcuts, and those are crutches and you might like them but I just want you to learn how to use your computer like
                                a real person uses the computer because when we start dealing with databases and files, you're gonna wanna know where you're at on your computer. And so if there's some fancy clicky button
                                thing that say automatically run Python, that's convenient but I want you to knwo all this stuff.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Okay enough about... (laughs) Well probably I'll just keep talking about that all the time. So now that we've got our problem. Write a program that uses input to prompt for their user name and
                                welcomes them. So this is pretty simple.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Go back to Atom, come on Atom. Okay, so we have to have a variable, n z t. Later we'll talk about choosing variable names. Right now I'm gonna choose a crazy variable name. Input is a function
                                and then you put a prompt, and that's supposed to be enter your name, colon, and I'm gonna put a space in there. So I'm gonna save that, and just run it for yucks. And there you go. That's one
                                thing you'll get used to is just typing gibberish really quick. And then we're gonna say print. What do we gotta say here? Print hello. (types on the computer) And go pull that variable back
                                out, save that command s, is how I'm savin' that, save command s, I saved it. So I didn't make file save, but I could've said file save but command s saves it, and now I can run it again. Zap.
                                Hello zap. So now I can run my thing. Oh and command k clears it. I don't remember what it is on Windows, but there's a way to clear your screen. I like to keep my screens clean. Hello chuck.
                                And so we have completed exercise 2.2 with a little program. Oh and by the way, I'm using alt tab. When you see this, I'm using the alt command tab and the same thing works on Windows as alt
                                tab. Okay?
                            </p>
                            <p>Okay, so I hope that was helpful to you. Just to kind of walk through one of the assignments, assignment 2.2 in Python for Everybody. </p>

                            <h3>Transcript</h3>
                            <p>
                                Hello, and welcome to Python for Everybody. My name is Charles Severence. In this short video I will be explaining how to run Exercise 2.3 where we prompt for some Hours, prompt for some Rate,
                                and multiply them together and print them out with a little paid message.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So this is 2.3. Some of you will immediately want to go to the Autograder and do your homework on the Autograder. I really would rather you didn't do that unless of course you're doing this
                                on an iPad or an Android or something where you can't install Python. But you have to realize that the Autograder isn't forever. You can only go so far with the Autograder and eventually you
                                have to write a real Python program. So I'll eventually show you how to run this in Autograder but I'm gonna instead show you how to run it in the terminal.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So I'm first gonna go into my Python for Everybody folder and I'm gonna make a new folder. Command+shift+N is what I just did there, ex_02_03 for Exercise 3. And so there's Exercise 3. And
                                I'm also gonna go into Atom which is my text editor and see, I have that folder. So I'm gonna make a new file and I will say print, I'll just say ("PY4E") and then I'll say File, Save As, and
                                I want to make sure it's in here, and it's gonna be ex_02. I don't like putting spaces in file names. Some operating systems can handle them but that's why I'm using underscores here. So I
                                would avoid using spaces in file names. So as soon as I give that a ("PY4E"), as soon as I give it a Python suffix, I'm there. And so it shows up there in my desktop.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                And now I'm gonna run the terminal program so that I can get there. So, cd Desktop, cd Python for Everybody, that's the folder on my desktop, and if I even do an ls, I see a couple folders and
                                a file. We can say ls minus l and see a little more detail that these two are folders and this one's a file. So, change directory, cd ex_02_03. And so now I'm in that folder and if I do an ls
                                minus l, I see that file. I can also do an ls without the minus l and see the file. And now I say, python3 ex_02_03.py, and it runs. You'll see me, no matter how many times you watch me, you'll
                                see the first thing that I do is get to the point where I know I'm in the right directory and I can run a little hello program before I start coding. I just don't like being crazy, right?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So now I'm gonna go back and take a look at my assignment. Enter Hours, you gotta prompt for hours, ask for a number. Enter Rate, prompt for rate, and then calculate pay. So there's a couple of
                                input statements here. xh is my variable I'm gonna choose. Later I'll choose more effective variables but for now I'm gonna make them silly. Enter Hours colon space and then I'm gonna copy and
                                paste and call this xr for Rate. When you're doing this, you need to be very careful. And so now I'm gonna calculate xp which is xh times xr, and then I'm gonna say print ("Pay:",) I don't need
                                to put a space because this comma effectively creates a space, xp. And then I'm gonna save that. I'm gonna switch to my terminal program, clear my screen in my terminal program, and I'm gonna
                                type up arrow, because I already typed python3 ex_02_03.py so my Hours, I'll just start with something really simple that I can calculate in my head, 10 and five.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Whoops. "can't multiply sequence of non-int of type 'str'". Here we have a traceback and again, I encourage you to realize that these tracebacks are not personal attacks by Python on you even
                                though they might be frustrating. (sighs) So the way to parse this is start by saying line 3, something's wrong at line 3. It's pretty good at knowing what line it is or it's either that line
                                or the line above it, and it's something about multiplying. What it's really saying is, "I'm confused. "I have to stop "because I cannot understand your instructions." So the problem here, of
                                course, is that this is of type string and so you can't multiply a string times a string, okay? So we can convert this using a float, so that's a function call now. We're passing the string xh
                                in and the value we get back is the floating point version of that and then we call float for this as well. Now I'll save that, always remember to save.
                            </p>
                            <p>So I'm gonna run it. I'm gonna run my Hours of 10 and my Rate of 10, and it's 100, and so that looks pretty good.</p>
                            <p>
                                So let's go ahead and try to run this in the Autograder, and this is my idea, is you'll take this, and you'll copy it, and you'll go back to the Autograder now and just paste this in. And so it
                                says, "Use 35 hours and a rate of 2.75." So let's check the code. 35 hours, OK. 75. Oh no, 2.75. Two point seven-five. And so it's running, and it's running, and it's running, and it works! And,
                                of course, now I've got my Grade. So this idea where you work here to get your assignment done correctly and then you run it in the Autograder is the way I intend for you to do it, but again,
                                if you can't do it that way, it's a great way to get started to just write your code in the Autograder. And, you know... You can change your code in the Autograder and then run it again. Of
                                course, this is gonna fail. 35. And 2.75. And of course you get a Mismatch, and now it's angry at you. The Mismatch here of course is because I print Howdy Pay in Pay, and it's real picky about
                                it, and you think, "Oh, I got the 96.25 right." Well, it doesn't really care so much about that. So let me go ahead and fix this and run it so we leave on a successful note! 35 hours and 2.75
                                as the rate per hour. That's kind of a low rate per hour. And we're getting successful and of course that means that you now have a grade on Assignment 2.3. Look at that, I got a grade on
                                Assignment 2.3. Unless, of course, you're running this in some other environment, okay? 
                            </p>
                            <p>Thank you so much and I hope that this has been useful to you. </p>
